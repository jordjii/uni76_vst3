# UNI 76 - project journal

This file is the living technical log for UNI 76. Keep it up to date as the
project moves forward; it is the fastest way for anyone (human or AI) to
get oriented without re-reading the whole codebase.

## What this is

- **Brand**: Nostalgia Audio
- **Product**: UNI 76
- **Purpose**: a universal vintage/analogue-style audio effect processor
  (not a synth).
- **Platforms**: Windows x64, macOS (Intel x86_64 + Apple Silicon arm64,
  built as a Universal Binary).
- **Format policy**: VST3 only. Do not add AU, AAX, VST2, LV2, or
  Standalone to the product build without a deliberate, separate decision -
  see `FORMATS` in `Source/Plugin/CMakeLists.txt`.

## Build architecture

- **CMake is the single source of truth.** Projucer is not used and must
  not be reintroduced.
- **JUCE 9**, fetched via `FetchContent` pinned to a specific commit (see
  `cmake/PluginIdentity.cmake`, `UNI76_JUCE_GIT_TAG`) for reproducible
  builds. Do not switch this to a floating branch.
- **AudioProcessorValueTreeState** is the parameter system.
  `juce::WebBrowserComponent` (+ `WebSliderRelay` /
  `WebSliderParameterAttachment`) is the UI bridge. Windows uses the
  WebView2 backend (statically-linked loader); other platforms fall back to
  their native WebView automatically.
- See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the folder-by-folder
  breakdown and [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for exact build commands.

## HTML/CSS/JS UI rule

- **HTML/CSS-first.** The GUI is built entirely in HTML + CSS + vanilla
  JavaScript (`Resources/Web/`), compiled into the plugin binary as
  `BinaryData` - never loaded from disk at runtime.
- **No raster UI assets.** No PNG/JPG, no SVG illustrations, no Canvas
  drawing, no CDN, no Google Fonts/external fonts, no external JS
  libraries or frameworks, no 3D/photoreal rendering. Knobs, ticks, scales
  and meters are all real DOM elements positioned/rotated with CSS custom
  properties and `transform` - see `Resources/Web/knobs.css` +
  `Resources/Web/knob.js`. The only permitted decorative effect beyond flat
  colour is very low-opacity CSS-generated grain/gradient (see the
  `.app::after` rule in `shell.css`) - never anything that reads as 3D.
- **One primary knob per processor.** Each of the 7 modules gets exactly
  one large interactive knob bound to its one public parameter. Any
  secondary read-out (the Preamp filter-position lines, the tri-point
  scales on EQ/Pitch/Pan/Verb/Imager) is purely a derived visual computed
  from that same parameter's value in JS - never a second control, never a
  second parameter.
- **7 immutable public parameters.** See below - the UI must never grow an
  8th knob or a new APVTS parameter without a deliberate, separate
  decision.
- No network requests from the frontend, ever. The one vendored exception
  to "no external JS" is `Resources/Web/juce_webview.js`, an unmodified
  local copy of JUCE's own `@juce-framework/webview` frontend module -
  it's part of the framework's own native bridge mechanism, not a
  third-party dependency.
- CSS is split by concern (`tokens` / `reset` / `shell` / `header` /
  `modules` / `knobs` / `scales` / `meters` / `responsive`), all sized in
  relative units (`rem`, `vw`, `clamp()`) rather than fixed pixels, so the
  UI scales with the editor instead of being pinned to a canvas size. See
  `Source/UI/WebUIEditor.cpp` for the resizable 3:2-locked window
  (600x400 min / 960x640 default / 1350x900 max) this is designed to fill.

## Immutable identity (do not change after first public release)

| | |
|---|---|
| Company | Nostalgia Audio |
| Product | UNI 76 |
| Bundle ID | `com.nostalgiaaudio.uni76` |
| Plugin manufacturer code | `Nsta` |
| Plugin code | `Uni6` |
| Version (current) | `0.1.0` |

Single source of truth: [`cmake/PluginIdentity.cmake`](cmake/PluginIdentity.cmake).
Do not duplicate these values by hand elsewhere - `include()` that file, or
read from `Source/Core/PluginIdentity.h` for the C++-only schema-version
constant.

### The 7 public parameters (stable IDs, do not rename)

`preamp`, `eq`, `saturation`, `pitch`, `panorama`, `reverb`, `imager` -
see [`Source/Parameters/ParameterIDs.h`](Source/Parameters/ParameterIDs.h).
All are `0..100%`. Default is `50%` for `eq` (its centred/flat "PHONE"
position) and `0%` for the other six (fully off, matching a console where
drive/saturation/pitch/width/space/image all start at zero). Low Cut /
High Cut are **not** separate parameters - they are internal to
`Source/DSP/PreampProcessor`, derived entirely from `preamp` (see
[docs/DSP_PREAMP.md](docs/DSP_PREAMP.md)).

## PREAMP DSP (the only module with real audio processing so far)

`Source/DSP/PreampProcessor.*` implements the `01 PREAMP / TRANSFORMER`
module's full signal chain - see
[docs/DSP_PREAMP.md](docs/DSP_PREAMP.md) for the topology, curves,
oversampling strategy, measured harmonic/frequency-response data, and
known tradeoffs in full. In short: DC/infrasonic protection, a
drive-dependent "transformer" coloration + asymmetric tanh waveshaper
(oversampled 4x at 44.1/48kHz, 2x at 88.2/96kHz, none at 176.4kHz+),
drive-dependent soft Low Cut/High Cut, output compensation, and a
latency-aligned enable/disable crossfade driven by `preampEnabled`
(`Source/Core/ModuleEnableState.h`).

**EQ, Saturation, Pitch, Panorama, Reverb and Imager remain a strict
passthrough** - do not add DSP to any of them without a separate,
deliberate decision. `Source/DSP/Eq.h` / `Saturation.h` / `Pitch.h` /
`Panorama.h` / `Reverb.h` / `Imager.h` are still empty placeholders.

### Per-module enabled/disabled state (not a parameter)

Each module has a persistent on/off flag (`Source/Core/ModuleEnableState.h`)
that survives editor close/reopen and host state save/reload - but it is
**deliberately not an 8th-through-14th APVTS parameter**: it's not a DAW
automation target. It's bridged to the frontend via two small native
functions (`uni76SetModuleEnabled` / `uni76GetModuleEnabledStates`, see
`Source/UI/WebUIEditor.cpp`) rather than a `WebToggleRelay`, and persisted
as plain properties (`preampEnabled`, `eqEnabled`, ...) on the same saved
ValueTree as the APVTS parameters, not inside the parameter tree itself.
Defaults to enabled; a saved state from before this flag existed loads as
enabled=true for every module (see `stateSchemaVersion` in
`Source/Core/PluginIdentity.h`). Once a module's DSP exists, its
`processBlock()` work should check this flag - today, with DSP still
passthrough everywhere, disabling a module is a UI-only visual mute and
has no audio effect, and the UI must not imply otherwise.

## Realtime audio-thread rules

`AudioProcessor::processBlock()` must stay realtime-safe: **no allocations,
no locks, no file I/O, no calls into the WebView/GUI layer**. This applies
to every module's DSP once it exists, not just at the foundation stage -
`Source/DSP/PreampProcessor` allocates its oversampler, scratch buffers,
and delay lines exclusively in `prepare()`; `process()` only reads/writes
already-sized buffers and plain-float filter state (see
`Source/DSP/Biquad.h`'s comment on why it isn't `juce::dsp::IIR::Filter`).
Allocate/lock/log on the message thread or in `prepareToPlay`, never in
`processBlock`.

**The one sanctioned exception is INPUT/OUTPUT meter telemetry**
(`Source/Core/LevelMeter.h`). `processBlock()` pushes the block's peak
magnitude into a lock-free `std::atomic<float>` (a compare-and-swap "keep
the max" loop - no allocation, no lock, no WebView/JS call of any kind from
the audio thread itself). A `juce::Timer` on the *editor*, running on the
message thread, is the only thing that ever reads/resets that atomic,
applies attack/release envelope smoothing, and forwards the result to the
WebView as a `meterLevels` JS event. Meters are telemetry only - not an
APVTS parameter, never part of `getStateInformation()`/`setStateInformation()`.
Follow this same push-an-atomic / read-on-a-timer shape for any future
audio-thread-to-UI data path; don't reach for anything heavier.

## Don't change working architecture without a reason

If something here works and is documented, don't refactor it "for
cleanliness" without a concrete reason tied to a real requirement. In
particular:

- Don't reintroduce Projucer.
- Don't move off the WebView-based UI bridge to a hand-rolled polling
  protocol - JUCE's relay/attachment mechanism already solves
  bidirectional sync correctly.
- Don't add DSP formats/effects beyond the 7 parameters without an explicit
  decision to start that stage of work.
- Don't add AU/AAX/VST2/LV2/Standalone targets without a reason.

## Current status (as of this entry)

**Stage: technical foundation + production UI + PREAMP DSP. EQ, Saturation,
Pitch, Panorama, Reverb, Imager remain deliberately passthrough.**

Verified on this machine (Windows, Visual Studio Community 2026 /
MSVC 19.51):

- Clean configure + build for both `windows-debug` and `windows-release`
  presets, **zero compiler warnings**, including `juce_dsp` (newly linked
  for PREAMP's oversampling).
- Real `.vst3` produced at
  `build/windows-release/Source/Plugin/UNI76_artefacts/Release/VST3/UNI 76.vst3`.
- All `UNI76Tests` (JUCE `UnitTest`-based) pass in both Debug and Release,
  including the full PREAMP DSP suite (see
  [docs/DSP_PREAMP.md](docs/DSP_PREAMP.md) for the harmonic/frequency
  measurements these tests generate): transparency near DRIVE=0%,
  `preampEnabled=false` bypass, bypass-transition continuity, harmonic
  growth 0%<50%<100% without hard clipping, DC-offset safety, Low
  Cut/High Cut actually changing measured frequency response with DRIVE,
  output-compensation bounding, mono, stereo channel independence, all 4
  sample-rate/oversampling tiers, 5 block sizes, automation sweeps,
  silence-stays-silence, NaN/Inf safety, and latency staying constant
  regardless of DRIVE/enabled state.
- **Real VST3 host validation.** A purpose-built harness using the real
  `AudioPluginFormatManager`/`VST3PluginFormat` hosting code (not
  `UNI76AudioProcessor` directly) loaded the built `.vst3`, confirmed all 7
  parameters, drove PREAMP through 0/50/100% via real `processBlock()`
  calls and confirmed the output is measurably different and stays
  bounded/finite at every setting, ran an 0->100->0 automation sweep during
  continuous audio, opened/closed/reopened the real WebView2 editor with
  no crash, and round-tripped the PREAMP parameter through a real
  `getStateInformation()`/`setStateInformation()` save+restore. Also
  confirmed identical behaviour from a `.vst3` copy in a completely
  isolated directory (no `Resources/Web` nearby), proving both the UI
  resources and the PREAMP DSP code are genuinely self-contained in the
  binary. `preampEnabled` bypass itself is verified at the C++ level
  (`Tests/PluginTests.cpp`) rather than through this external harness -
  like the editor's `IPlugView`, `ModuleEnableState` is deliberately not
  VST3-visible (no parameter, no exposed state format), so an external
  black-box host harness has no legitimate way to toggle it without going
  through the WebView native bridge, which - as established in the prior
  UI audit - such a harness cannot reach either.

Not verified (say so plainly rather than guessing):

- **macOS**: not built or tested - no macOS machine available in this
  session. `CMakePresets.json` defines `macos-debug`/`macos-release`
  presets targeting a Universal Binary (`x86_64;arm64`), but they are
  unverified.
- **pluginval**: not installed on this machine; installing a third-party
  executable validator from the internet was treated as out of scope. The
  AudioPluginHost-based validation above already covers real VST3 hosting,
  parameter automation, and state persistence, so this is a lower-priority
  follow-up than it was in the previous entry.
- **Windows/macOS production installers**: both `Packaging/*` folders are
  documented skeletons, not working installers (see
  [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md)).
- **Manual mouse-driven interaction** (literally dragging a knob with a
  mouse) wasn't exercised - the validation harness drives parameter
  changes through the host API, which exercises the same JS<->JUCE sync
  path a real drag would, but isn't a substitute for a human trying the
  actual pointer/wheel/keyboard interactions in a real DAW.

## Next steps (not started - waiting for a separate go-ahead)

DSP for the remaining 6 modules (EQ, Saturation, Pitch, Panorama, Reverb,
Imager - PREAMP is done, see [docs/DSP_PREAMP.md](docs/DSP_PREAMP.md)),
presets browser, copy protection, licensing system. See
[docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for the pre-public-release checklist.
